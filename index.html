     <p style="margin-top:30px;">Minecraft bedrock edition is a sandbox game that allows players lots of freedom to do what they want without any rules. We hope our website clarifies a few facts and illustrates the various features possible to use in Minecraft, and provide inspiration so that you can enjoy Minecraft to its fullest extent. In Minecraft, there are blocks in a 3-dimensional grid that restrict you to building in low resolution but allow you to build anything you want, unlike games like Fortnite that force you to only build very specific forts using a limited range of building blocks compared to Minecraft. There are mobs in Minecraft which you can fight in order to gain items that allow you to transform the world to anything you can imagine and do whatever you want.</p>

     <h2 class="whitetext">What to do on the first day of Minecraft</h2>
     <p class="whitetext">The fun thing about Minecraft is that it's ok to make mistakes! If you die you can always respawn and you don't need a tutorial in order to play it. However, if you feel embarrassed by making mistakes or need to play in a server, it would be more efficient to know what you need to do to gain items quickly. Some people just don't like having to experiment and see what happens, but prefer to follow a guide and play optimally. The first day is a race against time, because in just 10 minutes, night falls and monsters come out. When you first spawn, you want to find a tree or two to chop down for wood for tools. Then you would want to look around for caves. When you find one, climb down into it and <a href="Crafting.html" class="whitetext">craft</a> a crafting table and a wood pickaxe from the logs you found. Then, you will need to use it to mine stone which you will craft into stone tools. There are many tiers of armour and tools, which go from wood to stone to iron to diamond to netherite. Craft a stone pickaxe in order to mine any iron ore you see. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Also, mine any coal so you can craft torches so you can see in the dark, although you can see reasonably well with high brightness even underground, away from civilisation. However, in the depths of the caves you have to contest with dangerous monsters for the treasures hidden beneath. It is a risk you must be willing to take, although if you are bad at fighting you should make a stone sword at this time. <a href="Combat.html" class="whitetext">Here</a> is the webpage that specialises in combat. Once you mine 30 iron ore, create a furnace and smelt the ores to create iron ingots, which you can craft into tools and armour to become functionally invincible against most weak enemies. Although don't get cocky, some monsters like the creeper or enderman can still do considerable damage.
